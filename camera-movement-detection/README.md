# üìπ Camera Movement Detection System

**AI-Powered Camera Movement Detection for Smart Camera Systems**

This project implements an intelligent camera movement detection system that can distinguish between camera movements (tilt, pan, translation) and object movements within the scene. Built for the ATPTech Core Talent AI Coder Challenge 2025.

## üéØ Overview

### Problem Statement
In smart camera systems, it's crucial to detect when the camera itself moves (due to tampering, adjustment, or physical disturbance) versus when objects move within a static camera view. This system addresses this challenge using advanced computer vision techniques.

### Approach and Movement Detection Logic

Our solution employs a **dual-algorithm approach**:

1. **Frame Differencing**: Simple but effective method for detecting large global changes
2. **Feature Matching with Homography**: Advanced technique using ORB features to estimate camera transformation

#### Technical Implementation:
- **ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)** for feature detection
- **Brute Force Matcher** for feature matching
- **RANSAC** for robust homography estimation
- **Translation and rotation analysis** to distinguish camera movement from object movement

#### Movement Detection Criteria:
- **Simple Difference**: Average frame difference > threshold (10-100)
- **Homography Analysis**: 
  - Translation (dx, dy) > 5 pixels
  - Rotation angle > 2 degrees

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-format Support**: MP4, AVI, MOV videos and JPG/PNG images
- **Real-time Processing**: Efficient frame-by-frame analysis
- **Web Interface**: Streamlit-based user-friendly application
- **Parameter Tuning**: Adjustable sensitivity controls
- **Visual Results**: Preview of detected movement frames
- **Statistical Analysis**: Movement rate and frame statistics

## üìä Challenges and Assumptions

### Challenges Faced:
1. **Distinguishing camera movement from object movement** - Solved using homography analysis
2. **Handling different video qualities** - Implemented adaptive threshold parameters
3. **Processing large video files** - Optimized frame extraction and analysis
4. **False positive reduction** - Combined multiple detection methods

### Assumptions:
- Camera movement is typically larger than object movement
- Homography transformation can accurately model camera movement
- ORB features are sufficient for most video types
- User can adjust parameters based on their specific use case
